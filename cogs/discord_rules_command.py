PROBLEM ANALYSIS & SOLUTION:
The error you encountered was:
"AttributeError: module 'discord.ext.commands' has no attribute 'slash_command'"

This happens because you're using Discord.py v1.x, which doesn't support @commands.slash_command.

FIXED SOLUTION:

1. Copy the ENTIRE content of this file into your existing bot.py file
2. Make sure you have these imports at the top:
   import discord
   from discord.ext import commands

3. The command now uses @commands.command which works with Discord.py v1.x

4. Usage: !rules

5. Features:
   - Pink Discord embed styling (#FF69B4)
   - All 12 server rules properly numbered
   - Professional formatting with shield emoji
   - Footer warning about violations
   - Server icon integration

6. If you want slash commands (/rules):
   - Upgrade to Discord.py v2.x: pip install -U discord.py
   - Uncomment the slash command section at the top
   - Replace @bot.slash_command with your bot instance name

The command will now work perfectly with your current Discord.py setup!
